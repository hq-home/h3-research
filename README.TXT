7)   Windows(R), Virtual Memory, and Hard Disk Space:

The Windows(R) operating system requires a certain amount of virtual 
memory to function properly. The amount of virtual memory required by 
Windows(R) varies depending on how much of your computer's resources are 
required by an application.  Heroes of Might and Magic III, like most 
other games, requires the use of most of your computer's resources to 
run properly.

Therefore, for a Windows(R) application like Heroes III to run properly 
there must be sufficient free space on the hard disk with your Windows 
system folder.  As a general rule of thumb, you should keep enough free 
hard disk space equal to the larger of: two times the total amount of 
RAM your computer has; or, 10% of the space on the hard drive with 
Windows(R).

9)   Troubleshooting

Installation 

Problem: 	
	The CD is in the CD-ROM drive, but the computer is not 
	recognizing it. 
Answers: 	
	The CD may be dirty or scratched.
Solutions: 	
	1. Make sure that the data side of the CD (shiny side) is not 
	dirty or scratched.  If it is dirty, take a lint free 
	non-abrasive cloth and wipe gently to clean it (always wipe from 
	the inside of the CD to the outside edges).  If the data side of 
	the CD appears to be scratched, return the game to the store that
	you bought it from, and exchange it for a new copy. If you are 
	unable to exchange the game at the store that you bought it from,
	please call Customer Support for information on our exchange 
	policy.

Problem:	
	The computer freezes during install, or you receive an error 
	message (such as "*_ins error" or "An error has occurred during 
	the move data process") during install.
Answers: 	
	Your computer may be using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver; or 
	there may not be enough space on your hard drive for temporary 
	files to expand; or the CD-ROM drive might be having problems 
	with how it buffers information. Or, the Autorun or DMA settings 
	on your CD-ROM drive could be interfering with the game 
	installation.

To check and see if your computer is using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver:
	1. Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 'Properties'.
	2. Click on the 'Performance' tab.
	3. In the Performance status box, if the File System line says  
	"Some drivers are using MS-DOS compatibility", you are using a 
	16-bit CD-ROM driver.
Solutions:	
	1. For 16-bit CD-ROM drivers: Contact the manufacturer of your 
	CD-ROM drive or the manufacturer of your computer for an updated
	32-bit CD-ROM driver.

	2. For 32-bit CD-ROM drivers:
		1. Close all unnecessary programs running in the 
		Background.  Press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys at the same time
		to open the Close Program window, select a program, and 
		press the End Task button.  Repeat this process until all
		programs except 'Explorer' and 'Systray' are closed.
	
		2. Delete all files in your C:\Windows\Temp folder, then 
		empty the Recycle Bin.

	3. Turn off read-ahead on the CD-ROM drive:
		1. Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 
		   'Properties'.
		2. Click on the 'Performance' tab.
		3. Click on the 'File System' button.
		4. Choose the 'CD-ROM' tab at the top
		5. Change the 'Optimize access pattern for' field to 
		   'No read-ahead'
		6. Click on Apply, then OK and finally click Close (you 
		   will be prompted to restart your system).

	4. Turn off the Autorun and DMA settings on your CD-ROM drive:
		1. Right click on the 'My Computer' icon and choose 
		   'Properties'.
		2. Click on the 'Device Manager' tab.
		3. Click on the '+' sign next to the CD-ROM line so that 
		   it becomes a '-' sign.
		4. Click on the line that appears under the CD-ROM line 
		   so that it is highlighted, then click on the 
		   'Properties' button.
		5. Click on the 'Settings' tab.
		6. Look for the Auto-insert Notification and DMA lines.  
		   If there is a check mark in the boxes next to either 
		   of these lines, click on the box to remove the check 
		   mark.
		7. Click on the 'Apply' button, and then click on the 
		   'OK' button.
		8. When you are asked if you want to restart your system,
		   choose 'Yes'. 

You can restore all of the CD-ROM settings back to normal after the game 
has been successfully installed.



Launching the Game I

Problem: 	
	After launching the game from the Start menu or Desktop icon, you
	get a blank screen, a black box that surrounds the mouse cursor, 
	blurring or choppy graphics, vertical lines on the screen, choppy
	sound, or no sound.
Answer: 	
	There is probably a conflict between your video or sound card and
	Microsoft's DirectX.
Solution: 
For Windows 95 and 98 users: 
1. Press the 'Start' button on the Windows 95/98-task bar and select 
   'Run'. 
2. Type "c:\Program Files\directx\setup\dxdiag.exe" then click on the 
   'OK' button. This will run the DirectX Diagnostics Tool.
3. Make sure all your files are DirectX 6 compatible. Select the 'DirectX
   Files' tab make sure there are no exclamation points next to the file 
   names. If you find exclamation points under this tab you will need to 
   reinstall DirectX 6 by going to the 'START' Button on the Windows95 
   task bar then select 'RUN' and type your CD-ROM drive letter followed 
   by ": \DirectX\dxsetup.exe" and click on the 'Reinstall DirectX' 
   button. This will reinstall DirectX 6.
4. Make sure all of your drivers are DirectX 6 compatible. Select the 
  'DirectX Drivers' tab and make sure there are no exclamation points 
   next to any of the file names.  If you find exclamation points under 
   this tab you will need to update your drivers by contacting the 
   manufacturer of the hardware through their Phone Support or through 
   their web site. 3DO has a listing of manufactures sites available at: 
   http://www.3do.com/support.
5. Test your hardware with the DirectX 6 Diagnostics tool. Run the tests 
   that are available on the 'Display', 'Sound', and 'Input' tabs. If one
   or more tests fail, this could be due to driver incompatibility. 
   Installing the newest drivers available for your sound and video card 
   hardware can usually resolve this.

For Windows 98 users:
1. Press the Start button on the Windows 98 task bar and select 'Help'
2. Select the Search tab, type 'DirectX Troubleshooter' in the text box, 
   and then press the List Topics button.  Select 'DirectX Troubleshooter'
   in the Topics window, click the Display Button, and then follow the 
   instructions to troubleshoot your DirectX issue.

Launching the Game II

Problem:    
	You try to start the game and the screen flashes briefly, and you
	are returned to the desktop without an error message. 
Answer:       
	There are probably miscellaneous programs running in the 
	background that are interfering with the game and causing it to 
	crash. 
Solution:
	For Windows 95 users:     
1. Press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys at the same time to open the Close Program
   window.
2. Click on a program so that it is highlighted, then click on the 'End 
   Task' button.
3. Repeat this process until only 'Explorer' and 'Systray' are left in 
   the Close Program list, then try running the game.

For Windows 98 users:
1. Click on the Windows Start button, then choose Run.
2. In the Run line type in: "msconfig", then push the 'Enter' key. (This 
   will bring up the System Configuration Utility.)
3. Select the 'Startup' tab, and turn all of the check boxes off, except 
   for the one next to 'Systray'.
4. Press 'OK'. When you are prompted to restart your system, click 'Yes'.
5. Once your machine has restarted try running the program again. 

Video and Sound card manufacturers regularly update their software 
drivers to enhance performance and stability, and to improve 
compatibility with DirectX.  You can find links to many of these 
manufacturers' sites by going to the Driver Updates section of our 
support web site, which is located at http://www.3do.com/support. 

You may obtain a list of Microsoft-certified video and audio drivers for 
your hardware by going to http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl/.  Drivers 
listed here are confirmed to be compatibility with Windows 95, Windows 98
and Windows NT4.0. 

Microsoft updates DirectX and its components regularly and posts them for
download off of their web site at http://www.microsoft.com/DirectX.
