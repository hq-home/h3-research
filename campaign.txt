 * Note about Border Guards: in this campaign you have a choice of scenario order of completion (i.e. you may decide to play either Deal with the Devil or Neutral Affairs as your second scenario). Depending on your choice, you may collect different prizes in the final scenario of the campaign. If you did Deal with the Devil first, the blue Border Guard will be passable in that scenario, the red one will be available to you during Neutral Affairs, and you will collect the Sentinel's Shield (+12 d, -3 a) in the final scenario. If you did Neutral Affairs first, reverse the Border Guard availability issue and collect the Thunder Helmet (+10 k, -2 p) at the end. Regardless of what path you follow, make sure the same hero carries both quest artifacts when you complete each scenario.
